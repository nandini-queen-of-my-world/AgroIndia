    <h1>Agricultural Scenario in India</h1>
    <img src="https://i1.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2796724241_11bf55aa24_o.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
        Despite facing numerous challenges, the agricultural landscape in India has undergone remarkable transformations and achieved significant milestones. The introduction of the Green Revolution (1967-1978) not only resolved the issue of food scarcity but also turned India into a surplus food market. Over the course of three decades, India successfully established itself as a net exporter of food grains.

Interestingly, developed countries such as Canada, which were grappling with agricultural labor shortages, were greatly impressed by the outcomes of India's Green Revolution. They expressed their interest in inviting experienced farmers from India, particularly Punjab and Haryana, who were well-versed in the methods of the Green Revolution, to settle in their own country. Consequently, the Government of India (GOI) facilitated the migration of these farmers to Canada. As a result, there is now a substantial Punjabi-speaking population in Canada.

Furthermore, it is worth mentioning the remarkable achievements in the dairy and oilseed sectors in India. The white revolution and yellow revolution have played pivotal roles in these respective areas.

Currently, India holds the second position globally in terms of agricultural output. Additionally, it is the leading producer of milk, cashew nuts, coconuts, tea, ginger, turmeric, and black pepper. Moreover, India boasts the world's largest cattle population, with 193 million livestock.

India is also the second largest producer of wheat, rice, sugar, groundnut, and inland fish, while ranking third in tobacco production.

Notably, India contributes 10 percent of the world's fruit production and holds the top rank in the production of fruits like bananas and sapotas.

Presently, Indian agriculture is undergoing a phase of diversification. In recent years, there has been a significant emphasis on transitioning from conventional crops to high-yielding varieties (HYV). This shift has propelled Indian agriculture from a state of stagnation onto a path of growth, generating greater awareness and success.
    </p>
    <p>
        The role of agriculture in India's economy is of utmost importance, with its roots dating back to as early as 9000 BC. During this period, techniques were developed for settled agricultural production, leading to the domestication of crops such as wheat, barley, and jujube in the subcontinent. The agricultural sector significantly contributes to the productivity and stability of the country's economy, and it is widely believed that agricultural prosperity is fundamental to national prosperity. Agriculture accounts for approximately 18% of India's gross domestic product (GDP) and provides employment to 58% of the working population, while rural households primarily rely on agriculture as their main source of livelihood. It is one of the major contributors, along with fisheries and forestry, to the GDP. In the Neolithic period, new techniques emerged to enhance the agricultural system, including methods like threshing, row planting, cotton spinning, and grain storage in granaries. These improved techniques were passed down to subsequent generations, forming the basis for further agricultural development in India. The understanding of the origins and historical limitations on the distribution of useful plants gained from studying ancient agricultural practices has practical applications in various fields today. Therefore, it is relevant to examine the ancient Indian agricultural system to gain insights and knowledge for contemporary purposes.

    <h1>History Of Indian Agriculture</h1>
    <img src="https://render.fineartamerica.com/images/rendered/default/print/8.000/5.875/break/images-medium-5/indian-farmer-and-a-yoke-of-oxen-mary-evans-picture-library.jpg" alt="">
    <h3 id="ancient-indian-agriculture">Ancient Indian Agriculture System in Indus Valley Civilization</h3>
    <p>The agriculture system of the Indus Valley civilization was highly advanced for its time, drawing upon the technological achievements of the pre-Harappan culture. One notable advancement was the use of the plough. The farmers in the Indus Valley cultivated a variety of crops, including peas, sesame, dates, and even rice. Rainfall harvesting was the predominant method of agriculture practiced by the people of the Indus civilization. Archaeological discoveries have revealed that the civilization had a network of large reservoirs, which were crucial for meeting the water needs of the cities during the dry season.

        Mixed farming formed the foundation of the Indus Valley economy. The development of irrigation techniques played a pivotal role in the civilization's growth and prosperity. Irrigation systems were established in the Indus Valley Civilization as early as 4500 BC. These innovations in irrigation not only facilitated the expansion of agricultural land but also contributed to the overall prosperity of the civilization.
        
        The Indus Valley Civilization demonstrated impressive advancements in irrigation and water storage systems. Archaeological evidence reveals the existence of artificial reservoirs at Girnar dating back to 3000 BC. Additionally, an early canal irrigation system was developed around 2600 BC, showcasing the civilization's sophisticated understanding of water management and distribution.

    </p>
<h3 id="ancient-indian-agriculture">Ancient Indian Agriculture in Vedic Period</h3>
<p>During the ancient Indian agriculture practices, farmers commonly cultivated a diverse range of cereals, vegetables, and fruits. Animal husbandry played a vital role in their livelihoods as well. There was a prevailing belief that farmers who were closely connected to nature were also spiritually connected to God. The significance of seeds was highly emphasized, and a specific sequence of cropping was recommended to maximize productivity. Additionally, the practice of using cow dung as manure for irrigation purposes was widespread during this period.</p>
<br>
<h3>Ancient Indian Agriculture in Mauryan Empire</h3>
<p>During the reign of the Mauryan Empire from 322 to 185 BCE, significant advancements were made in agriculture. The empire introduced categorization of soils and made meteorological observations to enhance agricultural practices. They also undertook the construction and maintenance of dams to support irrigation. Additionally, the Mauryan Empire provided horse-drawn chariots, which were faster than traditional bullock carts, improving transportation for agricultural purposes.

    The Greek diplomat Megasthenes, in his book Indika, provides a first-hand account of Indian agriculture during that time. He describes India as a land with vast mountains rich in various fruit trees and fertile plains. The majority of the land was under irrigation, allowing for two crops to be cultivated each year. In addition to cereals, India produced millets, various pulses, and rice throughout the country. Megasthenes also notes that due to the presence of two monsoons annually, the inhabitants were able to harvest twice a year, maximizing agricultural productivity.</p>
<br>

<h3>Ancient South Indian Agriculture</h3>
<p>In Ancient India, the agricultural scene in South India was also thriving and prosperous. The people of the region cultivated a wide variety of crops, including rice, sugarcane, millets, black pepper, various grains, coconuts, beans, cotton, tamarind, sandalwood, jackfruit, coconut, palm, areca, and plantain trees, among others. 

    To ensure sustainable agriculture, the farmers in South India practiced systematic ploughing, manuring, weeding, irrigation, and crop protection. These practices contributed to the productivity and success of their agricultural endeavors. 
    
    Water storage systems were also developed during this period. Notably, the Kallanai dam, built on the river Kaveri in the 1st to 2nd century AD, is considered one of the oldest water-regulation structures in the world that is still functional today. This engineering marvel highlights the ancient South Indian civilization's knowledge and expertise in managing water resources for agricultural purposes.</p>
<br>
<h3>Ancient Indian Agriculture in Chola Period</h3>
<p>During the Chola Empire (875-1279), the agrarian society in South India underwent significant changes. The collective ownership of land gradually transitioned to individual plots, with each plot having its own irrigation system. The Chola rulers implemented a bureaucratic system to oversee the distribution of water, especially through tank-and-channel networks, to ensure water availability in drier regions. This shift toward individual ownership of farmland may have contributed to a decrease in areas under dry cultivation.

    In the pre-British period, the Indian economy consisted of self-sustaining villages and towns that served as centers of administration, pilgrimage, commerce, and handicrafts. The transportation and communication infrastructure was underdeveloped, resulting in a small market size. To comprehend the agricultural system in pre-British India, it is crucial to study the structure and nature of the village communities, the nature of internal and foreign trade, and the state of transportation and communication networks. These factors played a significant role in shaping agricultural practices and the overall economic landscape during that time.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="british-period">Agriculture System during the British Period</h3>
<p>The British rule in India can be divided into two distinct periods: the rule of the East India Company from 1757 to 1858, and the direct rule of the British Government in India from 1858 to 1947. The establishment of British rule was a gradual process that took more than a hundred years to complete. It began with the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and concluded in 1858.

    During this period, England itself was undergoing significant changes in manufacturing techniques, which led to a revolution in production. However, the British conquest of India had detrimental effects on the Indian society. The introduction of the new land revenue system and the commercialization of agriculture contributed to the disintegration of the village community. These changes resulted in the exploitation of the Indian peasantry and frequent famines in the country.
    
    It is important to note that the British administration showed little interest in developing India for its own benefit. Infrastructure developments such as railways, irrigation systems, and education were primarily initiated to serve the goal of economic exploitation and drain of resources from India.
    
    One significant contribution of the British rule was the establishment of local government institutions. Since the majority of the population lived in small villages and agriculture was the primary occupation, each village formed a township and became a unit of local government during this period.</p>
<br>
<h3>The land system during 1793-1850</h3>
<p>The British rule in India had a significant impact on the land system, with the introduction of two distinct systems: the zamindari system and the ryotwari system.

    In the zamindari system, which was implemented through the permanent settlement in Bengal and neighboring areas in 1793, revenue collectors known as zamindars were elevated to the status of private landlords. Land revenue was fixed in perpetuity, and the zamindars were required to deposit an enhanced amount to the state. This system was later extended to other regions, but with a temporary settlement where land revenue could be reassessed after a specific period.
    
    The ryotwari settlement, on the other hand, was implemented in large parts of Bombay, Madras, and subsequently in northeastern and northwestern India. Under this system, each individual peasant holding a plot of land was recognized as the landowner and became directly responsible to the state for paying the annual land revenue.
    
    Both land systems had negative consequences. The fixed land rents were often excessive, and both systems contributed to the destruction of the traditional village community based on customs and traditions. The zamindari system made the landlords masters of the village communities, while the ryotwari system created separate arrangements between each peasant cultivator and the state, undermining the cohesion of the village communities.
    
    The zamindari system created a class of people whose interests aligned with British rule but resulted in absentee landlords more focused on extracting higher land rents than promoting agricultural progress. Population pressure and high demand for land allowed zamindars to impose exorbitant rents and other exactions on tenant-cultivators. Consequently, the changes in the land system led to the emergence of subsistence agriculture and the concentration of economic power in the hands of absentee landlords and moneylenders.
    
    Even the ryotwari system deviated from its original intent as the burdensome demands of high revenue compelled peasant cultivators to sell their land to absentee landlords or moneylenders. Overall, the British land system introduced by Lord Cornwallis contributed to the concentration of economic power, depressed agriculture, and negatively impacted the peasantry in rural India.</p>
<br>
<h3>Commercialization of Agriculture (1850-1947)</h3>
<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.51520a3369cf8b281b316091f27a6c53?rik=JC28k2WJ2liA1w&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.environmentandsociety.org%2fsites%2fdefault%2ffiles%2fstyles%2fesp_image_large%2fpublic%2fthumbnails%2fimage%2fgrain-cart.jpg%3fitok%3dFREHkPaF&ehk=lsPVO1zgen%2bqsMQocW1FA6pe0sfKCyQr88a98mYCH2I%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" alt="">
<p>A significant transformation in Indian agriculture was the commercialization that occurred between 1850 and 1947. Commercial agriculture refers to the production of crops for sale rather than solely for family consumption. This shift was influenced by deliberate policies driven by the demands of British industries. By the mid-nineteenth century, the Industrial Revolution had reached its peak in England, creating a substantial demand for raw materials, particularly cotton, jute, sugarcane, and groundnuts.

    To meet this demand, the peasants in India were enticed to replace food crops with commercial crops, as the latter proved to be more profitable. The peasants shifted their focus to industrial crops, to the extent that in some districts, they even had to purchase food supplies from markets for their own consumption. This resulted in a decline in food production and, consequently, a period marked by severe famines in Indian economic history. The push for commercial agriculture was also influenced by the increasing demands for land revenue by the state and excessive rents imposed by landlords on the peasantry.
    
    The process of commercial agriculture was further facilitated by the development of an extensive railway network in India after 1850. The railways connected the interior regions of the country with ports, urban markets, and trading centers, enabling Indian agriculture to cater to global markets. Large quantities of wheat from Punjab, jute from Bengal, and cotton from Bombay were exported to England. Simultaneously, the railways transported machine-made manufactured goods from abroad back to India. This situation intensified commercial agriculture while intensifying competition between machine-made goods and Indian handicrafts, eventually leading to the decline of Indian industries.
    
    Overall, the commercialization of agriculture in India was driven by the demands of British industries, supported by railway infrastructure, which transformed Indian agriculture into a market-oriented system with both positive and negative consequences for the country's economy and industries.</p>
<br>
<h3>The New Land System</h3>
<p>Under British rule, a class of landlords was created to assume responsibility for land revenue, but the determination of rents was left to the free market mechanism. As the agricultural population grew and the demand for land increased, rents began to skyrocket. Land became an attractive capital asset, leading to a strong desire among the money lending classes to acquire land. The rising land prices also increased the value of land as collateral for peasants seeking loans. Consequently, agricultural debt among the Indian peasantry grew, exposing them to ongoing uncertainties.

    The exorbitant interest rates charged by money lenders made it nearly impossible for peasants to repay their debts. As a result, lands gradually passed into the hands of money lending classes, further exacerbating the impoverishment of the cultivating classes.
    
    The new land relations created a division between landowners and cultivators, whether through tenancy or daily wage labor. Landlords prioritized extracting high rents, leaving minimal returns for the cultivators. The heavy burden of rent payments and interest to money lenders significantly reduced investments in land. Cultivators had to surrender a significant portion of their produce to landlords and money lenders, resulting in a built-in disincentive for agricultural development. These new agrarian relations created a stifling environment that hindered the progress of Indian agriculture.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="modern-india">Agriculture System in Modern India </h2>
<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.86a5d2a47b82ee49a7cbe72e59e4fa69?rik=xazaLKwz4hZdAA&riu=http%3a%2f%2fhpc-asia.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2018%2f08%2fbigstock-Agriculture-Technology-Concept-210997102.jpg&ehk=sgwtBOOnnx9r0WWfSMOFxvnjfil818f73Ul6MTnpdq0%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" alt="">
<p>India's agricultural growth in the twentieth century has been relatively low compared to other developing countries. However, there have been significant developments in the agricultural sector during this period. At the time of independence, India faced a serious food shortage, worsened by the partition, which resulted in a decline in food grain production. The country had to rely on imports to meet the minimum food requirements of its population. Therefore, achieving self-sufficiency in food grain production became a top priority, as emphasized by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who stated that "everything else can wait but not agriculture." This perspective was reflected in various public policies and investment decisions, particularly related to irrigation, fertilizers, production techniques, land reforms, and community development.

    The Green Revolution in India emerged as a result of the systematic application of improved agricultural technology for crop production. The introduction of hybrid and high-yielding varieties of seeds brought about a significant technological breakthrough in the agricultural sector. This innovation was particularly crucial as it coincided with consecutive droughts in 1965-66 and 1966-67, which had severely impacted agricultural productivity in the country. The introduction of new agricultural technologies like biotechnology and the Green Revolution brought about significant changes in the agricultural sector, particularly through the use of high-yielding varieties, mechanization, and increased utilization of fertilizers and pesticides in irrigated areas. The Green Revolution had a positive impact on the agricultural economy of the country, leading to record gains in crop output.

    However, it is important to acknowledge that the Green Revolution and the adoption of high-yielding varieties have also had notable implications for the environment and society. One significant consequence is the reduction in genetic diversity as the focus shifted towards promoting monoculture of crops such as wheat and rice based on a narrow genetic base. This has had negative effects on the ecosystem.
    
    Other implications of the Green Revolution include the expansion of agricultural land through practices like shifting cultivation, forest land conversion, mono-cropping, and overgrazing. The use of high-yielding varieties has also led to a significant increase in pesticide application, which has resulted in the accumulation of toxic chemicals in the food chain, posing health hazards to livestock and humans. Additionally, the increased irrigation required for rice-based cropping systems has exacerbated issues like waterlogging in coastal areas.
    
    In recent years, however, there has been a decline in the total factor productivity of Indian agriculture due to the lack of continuous follow-up to the Green Revolution and the absence of significant technological breakthroughs. It is crucial to provide adequate support for conservation farming and green agriculture, particularly in the heartland regions that were at the forefront of the Green Revolution, in order to ensure a stable food security system and protect the environment.
   
   <br> Agriculture in India is still a traditional procedure. But when you compare it with the other foreign countries, they call it Modern Agriculture. The difference between both is the use of Technology methods in Agriculture. Technology and Modern methods in Agriculture have a huge scope in India, slowly, there is a shift that we can observe. But still, it is not on a par level when we compare with the other overseas countries. The most important reason behind this is the lack of awareness among the farmers. Hence we have tried our best to bring the latest Modern Technology methods to Agriculture.</p>
  <h4>Aeroponics System of Modern Farming Methods</h4>
  <img src="https://www.treehugger.com/thmb/ER5cEVl2P1hQOE3Xlbw_TcOpXOY=/755x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1219023699-95d4a0025e6b47769c6fa96082c2fd0f.jpg" alt="">
  
   <p>Aeroponics is the process of growing plants in an air or mist environment without the utilize of soil or an aggregate medium. The word “Aeroponic” is from the Greek meanings of aer and ponos. Aeroponics is a subset of hydroponics and works by suspending plant roots in the air and misting them with nutrient water. This method can provide a better level of control over the amount of water that is used throughout the growing process but may leave plant roots vulnerable to pathogens, if not carefully controlled.</p>
<h5>Benifits</h5>
<p><ul>
    <li>Ease of working with plants</li>
    <li>Cost-effective since won’t have to spend money on irrigation channels</li>
    <li>Aids in disease-free cultivation as plant-to-plant contact is limited and if a plant does become infected, it can be simply removed from the support structure without disrupting the other plants.</li>
    </ul></p>
   <br>
   <h4>Aquaponics</h4>
   <!-- <img src="https://www.treehugger.com/thmb/ER5cEVl2P1hQOE3Xlbw_TcOpXOY=/755x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1219023699-95d4a0025e6b47769c6fa96082c2fd0f.jpg" alt=""> -->
   <img src="https://www.diduknowonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/aquaponics-farm-978x652.jpg" alt="">
   <p>Aquaponics, on the other hand, is a closed-loop system that relies on the symbiotic relationship among aquaculture (fish) and agriculture (plants) for fertilization. While fish waste accumulates in the water and provides the nutrients essential for plant growth, the plants naturally clean the water. It provides a balanced, yet less regimented, environment.</p>
   <p>Aquaponics refers to any method that combines conventional aquaculture (raising aquatic animals such as snails, fish, or prawns in tanks) with hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) in a symbiotic environment. In normal aquaculture, excretions from the animals raised can accumulate in the water, increasing toxicity.</p>
   <h5>Benifits</h5>
  <p> <ul>
    <li>All normal fertilizer sources from fish waste.</li>
    <li>No reliance on mined and affected fertilizers.</li>
    <li>Efficient, sustainable, and extremely productive.</li>
    <li>Fish are free of expansion hormones and antibiotics.</li>
    <li>Allows continuous making of food.</li>
    <li>It produces both a protein and vegetable crop.</li>
    <li>The integrated method is sustainable and earth-friendly.</li>
    <li>Eliminating soil eliminates soil-borne diseases.</li>
    </ul></p><br>
    <h4>Hydroponics</h4>
    <img src="https://kj1bcdn.b-cdn.net/media/26321/farming.png" alt="">
    <p>The hydroponics method is a soil-less type of farming because it requires no soil for the plants to grow. Instead, it uses water as its growing medium. The knowledge of soil-less gardening is called hydroponics. It essentially involves growing healthy plants without the use of a traditional soil medium by using a nutrient like a mineral-rich water solution instead. A plant needs, choose nutrients, some water, and sunlight to grow. Not only do plants grow without soil, they often develop a lot better with their roots in water instead.</p>
    <p>The hydroponics farming method is a subset of hydroculture, which is a method of growing plants without soil by using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent. Terrestrial plants may be developed with only their roots exposed to the mineral solution, or the roots may be supported by an inert medium, such as perlite.</p>
    <h5>Benifits</h5>
   <p> <ul>
        <li>By providing constant and readily available nutrition, hydroponics allows plants to rise up to 50% faster than they would in soil. Also, fresh produce can be harvested from a hydroponic garden throughout the year.</li>
        <li>Great for both the environment and the mature product, hydroponic gardening virtually eliminates the need for herbicides and pesticides compared to traditional soil gardening.</li>
        <li>Any water that is used in hydroponic farm gardening stays in the system and can be reused, reducing the constant need for a freshwater supply.</li>
        <li>Arable land is often in small supply and gardening space continues to decrease. A huge option when you lack yard space or have a tiny balcony, hydroponics also lends itself really well to indoor gardening.</li>
        </ul></p><br>
        <h4>Monoculture of Modern farming</h4>
        <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.GykgSWKIJH5jy-wkSYwpZwHaE7?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" alt="">
        <p>The monoculture farming method is the raising of a single crop within a specified area. Most of the commercial farms in the United States are now monoculture in nature, with crops like corn and soy taking top billing. This is in contrast to the traditional technique of farming, which relied on multiple crops being planted within a specific area. Many indoor farms growing medicinal herbs and flowers are measured to be monoculture farms.</p>
        <p>Monoculture is the agricultural practice of producing a single crop, single plant, or livestock species, variety, or breed in a field or farming system at a time. Polyculture, where more than one crop is grown in a similar space at the same time, is the alternative to monoculture. Monoculture farming is widely used in both industrial farming and organic farming and has allowed increased efficiency in planting and harvest.</p>
        <p>When one crop is grown alone in a field, it is called a monoculture farm. Monoculture farming makes it easier to cultivate, sow seed, control weeds, and harvest, as well as expand the size of the farm operation and improve aspects of profitability and cost. At the same time, monocultures tend to promote the use of the other 5 basic practices of modern agriculture.</p>
        <h5>Benifits</h5>
       <p> <ul>
            <li>Reduced plant opposition for nutrients, space and solar radiation.</li>
            <li>Control of undesirable or unprofitable organisms.</li>
            <li>Reduction of costs by controlling specialized machinery required for arable operations.</li>
            <li>Maximize profit from the increasing of higher gross margin crops.</li>
            </ul></p><br>
    <h4>Tissue culture</h4>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/96/03/81/960381f26573b4642c294e1b393a77b0--plant-tissue-biotechnology.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Tissue culture refers to a method in which fragments of a tissue plant are introduced into a new, artificial environment, where they continue to function or grow. While fragments of a tissue culture are often used, it is important to note that entire organs are also used for tissue culture purposes. Here, such growth media as broth and agar are used to facilitate the procedure. While the term tissue culture farm may be used for both plant and animal tissues, plant tissue culture is the more specific term used for the culture of plant tissues in tissue culture.</p>
            <p>Tissue culture is the expansion of tissues or cells separate from the organism. This is naturally facilitated via the use of a liquid, semi-solid, or solid growth medium, such as broth or agar. Tissue culture normally refers to the culture of animal cells and tissues, with the more specific term plant tissue culture being used for plants.</p>
            <p>Tissue culture usually refers to the growth of cells from a tissue from a multicellular organism in vitro. These cells may be isolated from a donor organism, “primary cells”, or an immortalized cell line. The cells are bathed in a culture medium, which contains necessary nutrients and energy sources necessary for the cells’ survival. The tissue culture is often used interchangeably with cell culture.</p>
            <h5>Benifits</h5> <p><ul>
                <li>Tissue culture is a fast technique. Thousands of plantlets can be created in a few weeks time from a small amount of plant tissue.</li>
                <li>The new plants formed by tissue culture are disease-free.</li>
                <li>Tissue culture can produce, plants round the year, irrespective of weather or season.</li>
                <li>Very little space is needed for increasing new plants by tissue culture.</li>
                <li>It helps to speed up the creation of new varieties into the market place.</li>

                <h4>Drones in farming</h4>
                <img src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/fotolia88050102subscriptionmonthlym-7.jpg" alt="">
                <p>An agricultural drone technology is an unmanned aerial vehicle applied to farming in order to help increase crop production and monitor crop growth. Sensors and digital capabilities can give farmers a richer picture of their fields. This information may prove useful in civilizing crop yields and farm efficiency.</p>
                <p>Drone technology has been around for decades, taking to the skies to capture movie sequences, collect scientific information and scout territory. But there’s a different industry where drones are really beginning to take off farming.</p>
                <p>Agriculture is on tap to make up eighty percent of the market for unmanned aircraft in the next couple of decades. With the invention of newer, more effective technologies, drones in agriculture have the potential to launch the agriculture industry into a future of sustainability.</p>
                <p><ol>
                    <li><strong> More information, less time</strong>: One of the main benefits of drones is their ability to scout farm fields both quickly and efficiently. Rather than having growers evaluate field’s manually on foot or by tractor, this knowledge allows farmers to gain immediate knowledge about the status of their fields in shorter periods of time.</li>
                    <li><strong> Improving crop health and efficiency</strong>: Drone technology is very effective at collecting data to help farmers improve crop health. Equipped with sensors, drones flying over a field can collect plant height dimensions by gathering range information from the plant canopy and the ground below. By measuring near infrared wavelengths through a multispectral sensor, drone technology can also create vegetation index images, indicating which plants are healthy and absorbing maximum sunlight.</li>
                    <li><strong> Water efficiency and other environmental benefits:</strong> Thermal cameras are capable to detect cooler, well-watered field regions as well as dry hot patches. Farmers can utilize this data to adjust field irrigation and avoid wasting excess water. This capacity to increase water optimization is particularly valuable in drought-stricken areas, such as California. Most drones presently available for use in the agriculture industry are very costly. However, with new developments and more innovation, drones may start to prove their value in agriculture.</li>

                    <h4>Vertical farming</h4>
                    <img src="https://www.advancednutrients.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/aeroponics-and-NASA.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Vertical farming is the urban farming of fruits, vegetables, and grains, within a building in a city or urban center, in which floors are designed to accommodate certain crops. These heights will act as the future farms, land and as architects; we can figure these high-rises to sow the seeds for the future.</p>
                    <p>Vertical farming is, growing food indoors, in vertical layers; a concept global company has been experimenting with over the past 10 years filling old warehouses and disused factories with structures that develop vegetables and herbs in cramped, artificially lit quarters out of the warm glow of the sun.</p>
                    <p>Vertical farming is producing food and medicine in vertically stacked layers, vertically inclined surfaces and integrated into other structures. The ideas of vertical farming use indoor farming techniques and controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) technology, where all environmental factors can be controlled. These facilities develop artificial control of light, environmental control and fertigation.</p>
                    <p>Vertical farming has several advantages such as that it allows maximum crop yields. This means that vertical farming can permit crops to be grown at all times throughout the year, as it is not weather dependent. It can also be grown throughout the complete day and night as it uses L.E.D. lights since photosynthesis can occur at all times. One more advantage is that it reduces transportation costs as it will be cheaper for transportation since you can build vertical farms in cities, so you don’t need to import the crops from other regions. Vertical farming also grows food organically since no pesticides will be required as there are no pests to damage the crops. So it is healthier, safer and more eco-friendly. Finally the price is also another advantage of vertical farming. At the start vertical farming may be very costly, but after the first few years, it will become a cheaper form of farming. Also the price for the plants grown in vertical farms will also decrease.</p>
                    <h4>Hybrid Seed technology</h4>
                    <img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-68266916,imgsize-332267,width-400,resizemode-4/68266916.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>A hybrid seed technology is a cross between two or more unrelated inbred plants. The two dissimilar varieties are cross bred, resulting in a seed that carries one or more favorable traits. Hybrid seeds are commonplace in commercial farming, mainly to increase crop yields. In agriculture and gardening, hybrid seed is used to form by cross-pollinated plants. Hybrid seed production is major in modern agriculture and home gardening.</p>
                    <p>All of the hybrid seeds planted by the farmer will construct similar plants, while the seeds of the next generation from those hybrids will not consistently have the desired characteristics. Controlled hybrids provide very regular characteristics because they are produced by crossing two inbred strains.</p>
                    <p>Hybrids are chosen to develop the characteristics of the resulting plants, such as better yield, greater uniformity, improved color, disease resistance. A main factor is the heterosis or combining ability of the parent plants. Crossing any exacting pair of inbred strains may or may not result in superior offspring. The parent strains used are therefore suspiciously chosen so as to achieve the uniformity that comes from the uniformity of the parents, and the superior performance that comes from heterosis.</p>
                    <h5>Advantages</h5>
                    <p><ul>
                        <li>Additional vigorous plants</li>
                        <li>Enhanced disease resistance</li>
                        <li>Improved crop yields</li>
                        <li>Increased taste of fruits and vegetable.</li>
                        </ul></p><br>
<h3>Evolution of Plant Innovation and Protection</h3>
<p>In the past, the appropriation of plant innovation was based on the entire organisms and their reproductive capacity, as governed by the plant variety rights system. However, the development of biotechnological methods allowed for the manipulation of sub-cellular components of biological systems, challenging the traditional approach to plant appropriation. The patent system, which can be traced back hundreds of years, has evolved to accommodate these advancements. Recently, the western world adopted an "inventive" approach to the patent regime, granting patents for genes, proteins, biological processes, and even whole organisms, including varieties.

    However, developing countries had different priorities, focusing on the creation of new industries and investments rather than inventiveness. The subject-matter of plant varieties has also evolved over time. Mere discovery of a new variety is no longer sufficient for variety protection. The history of intellectual property protection for plant innovation involves attempts to fit plant innovation into traditional regimes such as trademark/unfair competition and patent regimes. This eventually led to the establishment of sui generis "plant variety" regimes.
    
    The issues of ownership and control of plant genetic resources sparked international conflicts, notably at the 1992 United Nations Environmental Conference in Rio. At this conference, the US opposed provisions on intellectual property rights in a proposed international treaty on biodiversity, bringing legal control of plant genetic resources to global attention. These discussions highlighted the importance of addressing ownership and control of plant genetic resources in an equitable and sustainable manner.</p>
